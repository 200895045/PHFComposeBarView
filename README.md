# PHFComposeBar

Introduction pending

## Installation

The prefered way is to use [CococaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

```ruby
pod 'PHFComposeBar', '~> 1.0.0'
```

If you can't use CocoaPods for some reason (you really should though, it's the
cool kid on the block), then grab the `PHFComposeBar*.{h,m}` files and put it
in your project.  The code uses ARC, so make sure to turn that on for this file
if you're not already using ARC.
